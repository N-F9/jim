Jim provides tools that the Ti-84 Plus CE does not, like solving triangles. Jim will not have the funcationality to solve polynomials (use the polynomial root finder from Ti), for example.

→ Pre-Installed Tools on the TI-84
- arithmetic, trig, & piecewise
- science tools & periodic table
- graphing, features w/ variables, inequalities, & conics
- polynomial root finder & systems of equations
- calculus:
	- summation
	- integrals
	- derivatives
- statisitics

→ Tools Jim Provides
- solving triagles w/ ambiguous cases
- areas & perimeters
- unit circle
